# NFT Exclusive Licence

This work was published to fill a gap in the licensing documents available to NFT creators, platforms and collectors and to inspire better versions of NFT licensing for use by this community. It is the work of [Paul Imseih](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pimseih/) and is licensed for use under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

It was initially inspired by the work of  [Gabriel Shapiro](https://twitter.com/lex_node) & [Stuart Smolen](https://bsvlaw.com/team/stuart-smolen-partner/) who developed a Rarible-sponsored version of NFT licensing. The author thanks in particular [Gabriel Shapiro](https://twitter.com/lex_node) for the huge amount of work and research that he has shared with the world.

That said, the author identified several major issues with the [Rarible licensing model](https://github.com/rariblecom/nft-license) as it appears to have been derived from the position of that platform's specific needs and commercial imperatives. In short, it didn't seem fair to collectors, users or NFT Creators. It granted NFT platforms the broadest set of rights while taking on the bare minimum of risk, passing that on to Collectors and NFT Creators.

It was also limited for use on Ethereum whereas the licence presented here is open to all platforms that use NFTs based on the ERC or similar standards, recognising the rich tapestry of blockchains being developed around the world. You simply need to fill in the blanks highlighted within the definitions.

There are still some potential privity issues with this (and nearly every) NFT license, particularly where it grants rights to sublicensees without any apparent constraints. For example, the author does not think it reasonable to allow sublicensees to receive licence rights *broader* than those granted to collectors themselves. The author has addressed that by way of placing obligations on licensees to ensure their sublicensees comply with the terms of the license. Really, if a Creator or Collector is going to sublicense the NFT, that should be done on terms at least as strict as those imposed on the licensees themselves.

This licence is an attempt to move the risk dial back to point where those profiting most from NFT transactions take on the most risk (as one would expect in most risk-reward equations). The risks in this instance are not too severe: they require those who create or sell NFTs to promise buyers that they will not be subject to third parties claiming infringement of copyright or some other intellectual property right.

For example, if Alice buys an NFT in good faith from Bob, she is entitled to rely on Bob's promise that she won't find herself subject to third party lawsuits claiming Bob stole or copied their artwork. And if there is a claim by a third party, Bob and the NFT Gallery/Platform should step in to handle those claims on Alice's behalf.

**Please note that the author is not providing you legal advice by publishing this work and you should seek the advice of a qualified lawyer when determining whether this licence is suitable for your specific needs. Unless you have engaged the author or his firm, there is no solicitor-client relationship between you and the author. You should be aware that Intellectual Property Law around the world is complex and there is a risk that this NFT Licence is not enforceable where you live, work and love.**

**Also note that many NFT platforms/galleries/auction houses use their own terms and conditions to engage creators and collectors and it is likely that attempting to use this licence (even if embedded within the NFT metadata) will fail and be superseded by their terms and conditions. The author's hope is that more NFT Platforms, NFT Galleries and Auction Houses use these terms to provide certainty and a fair allocation of risk for all parties.**

Some information about the licence:

* This is an “exclusive license” where the NFT Creator agrees not to grant further licenses to the image except those already tied to the original NFT or batch of NFTs.
* This version of the license limits an NFT collector's use of the image significantly and is not suitable if the intent is to allow the collector to generate a commercial benefit from the use of the image beyond attempting to on-sell the NFT at a profit.
* The License subrogates in some cases the rights of collector and NFT platforms to the NFT Creator (meaning the collector takes on much of the rights of the NFT Creator), so that a collector (in cooperation with a willing NFT platform) can bring their own legal action against unauthorised use of the images. If this occurs, the expectation is that NFT Creators will provide reasonable assistance to any enforcement efforts undertaken as it is in their interest as well to protect their intellectual property, especially where they still hold some NFT tokens with the affected images.
* Unlike garden variety licences for works of art or software,  NFTs present unique challenges, for example when dealing with network forks. This License provides that NFTs will only be honored, from an IP perspective, on a subset of forks which are called 'persistent forks'.
* The License contains a variety of use restrictions that apply to collectors. For example, it prohibits the collector from incorporating the relevant image into merchandise or using the image in a manner which is considered defamatory or pornographic. Depending on the nature of the images being developed by creators, this section is one area that requires closer inspection and adjustment.What follows is a partial summary of what we see as key features of the License, together with some notes about how we see the License fitting into NFT culture:
* The License is optional. You can always use your own licence (if you understand the legal ramifications of doing so). The author strongly recommends **against** issuing NFTs without an underlying licence. To do so leaves a creator exposed to exploitation and abuse of their work, especially in countries that do not provide automatic copyright and moral rights protections.
* It is not necessarily suited to other uses of NFTs because it is designed primarily for use with visual works of art. The License would not be suitable for other uses of NFTs (for example audio recordings, video, property deeds, securities, financial products and other amazing and wonderful mash-ups offered by NFTs) without reviewing the terms and adjusting them to reflect the specifics of the NFT in question.
* The licence assumes that there is a NFT which is tied to an image and that the pairing of such NFT and image (the ‘Collectible’) is meant to have inherent artistic or consumer value. It is not necessarily suited to other uses of NFTs because it is focused on visual works of art. The License would not be suitable for other uses of NFTs without reviewing the terms and adjusting them to reflect the specifics of the NFT in question.
* The License seeks to permanently tie certain intellectual property rights in an image to an NFT. By using the License, the NFT creator is making a legal representation that the artist has the requisite intellectual property rights in the image to make this link enforceable. That means the NFT creator is either the artist who created the image or has a valid sufficient license from the creator of the image.
* Under the License, the artist retains ownership of inviolable moral rights and other intellectual property rights in the image. The sale of the NFT is not a sale of the image, but a license of certain rights in the image.

The License seeks to permanently tie certain intellectual property rights in an image to an NFT. By using the License, the NFT creator is making a legal representation that the artist has the requisite intellectual property rights in the image to make this link enforceable. That means the NFT creator is either the artist who created the image or has a valid sufficient license from the creator of the image. Thus, loosely speaking, the License is intended to make the NFT similar to a transferable instrument of title to the licensed image rights. However, as noted above, the treatment of tokens as contractual instruments is of uncertain enforceability under the Uniform Commercial Code (as it may be implemented in various U.S. states).

Under the License, the artist retains ownership of inviolable moral rights and other intellectual property rights in the image. The sale of the NFT is not a sale of the image, but a license of certain rights in the image.

I hope the reader will find some use from the attached licence or even contribute to its continued development and improvement.
